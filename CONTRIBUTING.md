# Contributor Guidelines

## Getting started

To set up your local environment, from the top level of the checkout run

`./contrib/setup`

This will create pre-commit hooks to fixup many code style issues
before your code is submitted.

On some Linux distributions this will install all build dependencies
needed to compile fwupd as well.
