Dell Recovery Media Creator
----
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dell/dell-recovery.png)](https://travis-ci.org/dell/dell-recovery)

The Dell Recovery media creation tool supports two different usage modes,
"End User Mode" and "Builder Mode".  In End User mode, the tool will simply
create an image from an existing recovery partition with no customizations.
In builder mode, the tool allows modifying the source of the base image,
the source of the framework, as well as injection of additional content.

End User Mode
---
When a customer receives a Dell machine that has been factory shipped
with Linux, there will be an icon in the unity program list to launch this
tool.  They will only be asked what type of media they would like to create.

OEM Config mode
---
If a DVD burner or USB port is found on the machine, they will be offered
to create media in end user mode from OOBE (OEM Config)

Builder Mode
---
In builder mode, the user will be offered a variety of options that allow them to create ISOs based upon different
snapshots of release upon standard Ubuntu media.

The latest information on how to use builder mode will be documented within the integrated help dialog.


Ubiquity
---
Dell recovery is built with an integrated Ubiquity plugin.  It is branched with each Ubuntu release and has code
that will tightly integrate with Ubiquity for factory installation.  Documentation for all of the features
in Ubiquity mode and how to create packages to support it are stored outside of the dell-recovery tree.

Modifying a factory image
---
Information about how to modify a factory image are available here:

Standalone Mode
---
This mode allows using Dell Recovery without ubiquity to simulate FI for non-Ubuntu process.
